# StockAnalysis
My topic is analysis of stock data using Hadoop framework. Apache Hadoop is a software framework that supports data-intensive distributed application under a free license. Hadoop was inspired by Googleâ€™s MapReduce and Google File System (GFS) papers. Hadoop, however was designed to solve a different problem: the fast, reliable analysis of both structured data and complex data. As a result, many enterprises deploy Hadoop alongside their legacy IT system, which allows them to combine old data and new data sets in powerful new ways. The Hadoop framework is used by major plays including Google, Yahoo and IBM, largely for application involving search engines and advertising. I am going to represent how to analyze the large dataset problems using Hadoop.
